## Description

My project investigates the intersection of causal inference and predictive analytics using a dataset of student grades and background information.
The goal was to determine whether causal inference methods could complement traditional predictive analytics by providing deeper insights into
the relationships between features (e.g., study habits, family background) and student performance outcomes.

**Some potential use cases for the project are:**
- Educational Institutions: Schools or universities could use this approach to identify actionable factors (e.g., study habits, parental education) that influence student performance and design targeted interventions.
- Policy Making: Policymakers could leverage causal insights to allocate resources more effectively, such as funding for tutoring programs or parental support initiatives.
- Data Science Teams: The methodology could be applied to other domains (e.g., healthcare, marketing) to uncover causal relationships and improve decision-making.



- **Limitations**  
  - Dataset was relatively small (145 observations) and lacked granularity, which limited the robustness of the causal inferences.
  - The causal graph relied on a lot of assumptions that may not fully capture the complexity of real-world relationships, potentially introducing bias.
  - Findings are specific to the dataset and may not generalize to other contexts without further validation.
  - 

- **Future features**  
  - Integration of more advanced causal inference techniques.
  - Expansion of datasets for broader analysis.
